# Batchcamp

It's Bandcamp Friday. You just bought the whole Shall Not Fade discography and now you're sitting there opening each individual release in a new tab, waiting for the spinny thing to show the download link, clicking the link, going to the next tab, waiting for the spinny thing, whoops, you are trying to download too many at once so here’s an error.

Now you have to wait until a few finish before starting more. Going back to your tabs, waiting for the spinny thing, clicking download. You don’t have time for this, you have a set at the Student Union tonight and need to fill your USB with cheeky Speed Garage edits of Pop tunes ASAP. 

If only there was a better way... 

## Features
- Multi-select using Shift+Click
- Automatic download management

## Setup

*Chrome Web Store submission is pending. For now you will have to install manually*

Download the zip from the [releases page](https://github.com/hyphmongo/batchcamp/releases/tag/v1.0.0)

Or to build from source

```
npm install
npm run build
```

Then add to Chrome by following the instructions for [loading an unpacked extension](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/getstarted/#unpacked) and pick the extracted folder from the zip or the `dist` folder if you built from source

## Big Room Tech House DJ Tool - TIP(s)!

If Chrome keeps popping up and asking you where to save each download: open up your Chrome settings, search for **Ask where to save each file before downloading**, and toggle it off

Multi selecting works using the Shift key. To select everything in your Collection scroll all the way down and keep scrolling until you have loaded everything. Hold down your Shift key and check the final item in the list. This should select everything
